# Library

A project to consolidate understanding of objects and object constructors in JavaScript. Additionally, an opportunity to learn about dialogs and modals and how to associate DOM elements with JavaScript objects.

The project currently does not store state between refreshes. That's a feature I plan to possibly come back to in the future.
